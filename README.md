# Artificial-Neural-Networks

- loc gets rows (or columns) with particular labels from the index.
- iloc gets rows (or columns) at particular positions in the index (so it only takes integers).

- Dendrites are receiver of the signal axon the neuron and axon is the transmit of the signal for the neuron
- Axon doesn't touch the Dendrites

## Activation Function :
- Sigmoid Function 
- Threshold Function 
- Rectifier Function
- Hyperbolic Tangent Function

## Cost Function :
- Cost function Calculate the output & Actual Value diffirence 
- C = 1/2(Actual Value - OutPut Value)^2
- Need to be cost function to be very minimum or zero.

## Backpropagation :
- Its means adjust the Weight(W) simultiniously
